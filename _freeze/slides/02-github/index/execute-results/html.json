If you have previously set your GitHub PAT in .Renviron, stop doing that.\n\n*Highly recommend reading this entire vignette and following all guidance*\n\n## sitrep and vaccinate\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usethis) # make sure > v2.0.0\ngit_sitrep() # current situation report\ngit_vaccinate() # add files to global .gitignore (best practice)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Get a personal access token (PAT)\n\nFirst, make sure you're signed into GitHub. Then run\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::create_github_token()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- Add Note describing use-case (e.g. personal-macbook-pro-2021, project-xyz)\n- Select expiration (recommend default 30 days)\n- Check scope\n- Click 'Generate Token'\n- **Important!** Copy token to clipboard, do not close window until stored (see next slide)!\n- You may want to store token in a secure vault, like 1Password or BitWarden\n\n## Put your PAT into the local Git credential store\n\nBy installing **usethis**, you will also have the **gitcreds** package to manage git credentials.\n\nPut your PAT into the Git credential store by running the following command and entering your copied PAT at the prompt (assume the PAT is on your clipboard).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- If you don't have a PAT stored, will prompt you to enter: paste!\n- If you do, you will be given a choice to keep/replace/see the password\n  - choose as appropriate\n  - if replacing, paste!\n  \n## PAT maintenance\n\n- By default token will expire after 30 days.\n- Return to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click on its *Note*\n  - or else click on link in e-mail telling you token is about to expire!\n- Regenerate token\n- rerun `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`\n\nA bit of a pain to do this every month, but only takes a couple of minutes.\n\n## Your turn!\n\nIf you need to, generate and store a PAT, as described over last few slides and in the [vignette](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).\n\nIf you already have a PAT set, read the vignette and follow through on other best practice recommendations.\n\n## Create an RStudio project from a GitHub repo\n\nNow you can clone your GitHub repo locally.\n\n- Go to your repo homepage on GitHub. Click the green \"Code\" button, copy the HTTPS address (of the form `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`).\n\n- In RStudio, go to File > New Project… > Version Control > Git.\n\n  - Enter the repo URL you just copied. The project directory name will be filled automatically.\n  - Browse to a location you want the project directory to be created.\n  - Click `Create Project`.\n\n## Git tab\n\nA Git tab is added to the pane that is in the top right by default, usually with Environment, History, and Connections tabs.\n\nThe initial view is equivalent to the output of the terminal command `git status`. \n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nWe can *stage* changes to commit\n\n![](images/stage_changes.png)\nUnderlying command:  \n`git add <file/folder>`.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nThen *commit* a set of changes\n\n![](images/commit_changes.png)\nUnderlying command:  \n`git commit -m \"commit message\"`\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## .gitignore\n\nAt this stage you should see two untracked files in your Git Pane that were created when setting up the project: an `.Rproj` file and a `.gitignore` file.\n\nThe `.gitignore` file specifies files that git should ignore - they won't appear in the git pane even as untracked files. \n\nExamples of how to specify files in `.gitignore`:\n\n- Single file: `.Rhistory`\n- File pattern: `*.log` (all files with `.log` extension)\n- Directory (and files in it): `/dirname/`\n\nThe `.gitignore` file must at least be staged to have an effect.\n\n## First commit from RStudio\n\n- Stage and commit the `.Rproj` file and `.gitignore` file, with the message \"setup RStudio project\".\n\n- Click on the clock icon in the Git pane to view the history of previous commits. \n\n- Close the \"Review Changes\" window. Now click the green up arrow to push your changes to GitHub.\n\n- Go to the repo on GitHub and verify your changes have been pushed.\n\n## Pulling changes from GitHub\n\n- Edit the README once more on GitHub in a new commit.\n\n- Back in RStudio, on the Git tab, click the blue down arrow to *pull* the changes from GitHub\n\n- The changes to README should now appear in your local copy\n\n## Avoid conflicts\n\nIf you work on both the local and GitHub copy, it's possible to get out of sync and end up with conflicting versions of the same file.\n\nIt *is* possible to fix this, but it can be tricky/confusing. It's best to avoid problem in first place!\n\nRecommended practice:\n\n- Always commit and push changes at the end of an RStudio session\n- Always pull changes at the beginning of an RStudio session\n\n## Set `.Rprofile` to check git status\n\nThis is a neat trick (credit: Lisa De Bruine)\n\nOpen your `.Rprofile`\n```r\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n```\nand add the following (credit: Lisa De Bruine)\n```r\ncat(cli::col_blue(system(\"git status -u no\", TRUE)))\n```\nThis will run `git status` from the command line when you start R, giving a (blue coloured!) message e.g.\n```\nOn branch main Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit,\nand can be fast-forwarded.   (use \"git pull\" to update your  \nlocal branch)  nothing to commit, working tree clean\n```\n\nIf your main branch is behind the main branch on _origin_ (GitHub), you should pull changes before making new edits.\n\n## Advanced: Amend commit (before pushing)\n\nSometimes we don't stage everything we intended to include in a commit, e.g. we committed a file before saving the latest changes.\n\nIf we haven't yet pushed the commit to GitHub, simply stage the extra commits and check the \"Amend previous commit\" box under the commit message. \n\nThe original commit message will be shown - you can edit this to change the message for the amended commit (useful if you forgot to reference a GitHub issue number)\n\n## Advanced: Undo last commit (before pushing)\n\nAlternatively, you can undo a commit before pushing.\n\nTo undo the commit, keeping files as they are\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\ngit reset HEAD~1\n```\n:::\n\n\n(change the 1 to a higher number to go back more than 1 commit).\n\nTo undo the commit *and all the changes in that commit*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis goes back to the version at the last commit. \n\n## Advanced: Undo last commit (after pushing)\n\nIt is best practice to create a new commit that undoes the changes. Run\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\ngit revert HEAD\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis edits the files to undo the changes in your last commit. You should then commit these edits, with a relevant message.\n\nIt is possible to use `git reset --hard` to undo a commit and then `git push origin main --force` to force this change onto GitHub. Sometimes repository maintainers do not allow this as it rewrites the history, which can cause problems for people that have cloned or forked your repo.\n\n## General workflow\n\n* Commit regularly, once you've got a small complete change, e.g. a working draft of a function, a bug fix, a draft of a README.\n\n  - It is easier to review/revert changes if they relate to a single file or common issue\n \n - Ideally, make a commit everytime you make a substantial, coherent set of changes.\n \n - At least make a commit every time you take a break, especially when leaving at the end of your working session\n\n* Push often enough that GitHub is a useful backup\n \n\n## Adding an existing project to GitHub\n\nThe simplest approach is to create a GitHub repo with just a README as before, create the corresponding RStudio project, copy your files into the new directory, stage and commit them.\n\nIf you are already using git and want to move the project to GitHub, see [Adding a local repository to GitHub using git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git). Once the project is on GitHub you can clone it into an RStudio project.\n\n## Some other tools\n\n- [gert](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/) R package has functions for interacting with git\n\n- It can be worth using dedicated software for interacting with git/GitHub\n\n  - [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com)\n  \n  - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)\n\n## Summary\n\n- Working openly encourages good practices\n\n- Your code/software is an asset!\n\n- We can make steps to improve our own practice\n\n- git and GitHub are invaluable resources for version control and collaboration\n\n# {#github-friends data-menu-title=\"GitHub for collaboration\" background-image=\"images/github_friends.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Learning more\n\n- Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Bryan\n\n  <http://happygitwithr.com>\n\n- GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing and failing safely by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes\n  \n  <https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/05/27/github-illustrated-series/>\n\n- Version control: A practical introduction to Git and GitHub\n\n  <https://www.jvcasillas.com/github_workshop/index.html#1>\n\n# End Matter {.inverse}\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/){target=\"_blank\"}).\n",
